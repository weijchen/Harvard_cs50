1.  A header file in the C standard library. Define a set of integral type alisases with specific width requirements, along with macros specifying their limits and macro functions to create values of these types.
2.  These types of variables are only appropriate for code that requires a signed integer type. For example, int8_t is a 8 bits variable. Because bit-length of word might be different between os, we can prevent it with these kind of variable. u- are negative variables.
3.  BTYE = 1 byte; DWORD = 4 bytes; LONG = 4 bytes; WORD = 2 bytes
4.  424d
5.  bfSize is the size of the whole bmp file, biSize is the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER header file, which is constrained to 40 bytes.
6.  If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB(Device Independent Bitmap) with the origin at the upper left corner.
7.  biBitCount
8.  The file doesn't esist. / The file is opened in sa mode that doesn't allow other accesses. / The network is down. / The file exists, buy no permissions to it.
9.  Third argument states how many elements we want to read. Because we're always reading a struct, we only need 1 struct.
10. 3 -> 1. ((3*3) % 4) = 1 / 2. (4 - 1) % 4 = 3
11. Set reading function's position to a new position.
12. One of argument in fseek(), tells the current position of the file pointer.
